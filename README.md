# Note# (NoteSharp)

## About

NoteSharp is just a Notepad clone made for practicing GUI creation with WinForms with C#.

It features the basics of a text editor:

- **Dynamic history**: User can navigate through the actions made to the document's body. It can also be truncated if user makes some change on a past action.
- **Save and load**: NoteSharp is able to save and load documents as .txt files.
- **Shortcuts**: Menu actions can be triggered by shortcuts on the keyboard.
- **Zoom**: Text can be zoomed in and out with mouse's wheel.
- **All text selection**: All the text can be selected with Ctrl+A.

## Disclaimer

NoteSharp was made with the only intent of testing WinForms and toying a bit with some advance capabilities of C# (functional programming, WinForms widgets and such).

That means, it's very likely that NoteSharp will be abandoned and no longer mantained without any anouncement. Use it at your own risk.
